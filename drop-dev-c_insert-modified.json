The inability of the Ottomans to yca(ptuCre Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and HesYtWablishhed a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, \" The failure of the first brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past. \" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman ' s main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of Awhic$h was under Habsburg control.

Throughout the m174o0s, the H!anth(awba@ddy forces were winning against Upper Burma - based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma si+nc4e a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam. Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza _Dipoadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs. By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751. While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm fbeLlls in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two - thirds of their army yb8ack down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752. This redeployment of Hanthawaddy trooSpqs proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance ugroQups much needed breathing room. The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10, 000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma. Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops, one resistance group, the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754. Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma in 1755, and captured Pegu in 1757, ending the 17 - year - old Mon kingdom.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1317, "text": "1752"}], "question": "When did the Hanthawaddi withdraw most of their troops from Upper Burma?", "id": "381ef468-9cc8-4b70-98b2-eab5183952b3"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1828, "text": "17"}, {"answer_start": 1828, "text": "17"}, {"answer_start": 1828, "text": "17"}], "question": "How many years was the Mon kingdom", "id": "1e50dd00-e837-4ecc-8265-83365d286aa4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1828, "text": "17"}, {"answer_start": 1828, "text": "17"}], "question": "How many years did the Mon kingdom last for?", "id": "f30a67b1-f4bc-4234-916f-fcfbd108fd06"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1278, "text": "toppled the last Toungoo king"}], "question": "Which happened later, the toppling of the last Toungoo king or the invasion of Lower Burma?", "id": "e189f0bc-9a08-403a-9d85-223ee630540a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 382, "text": "the Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 243, "text": "The Siamese"}], "question": "Who sent a diplomatic mission to Ava in 1745?", "id": "9c705782-ac19-40ab-9a34-1e615ed4a96f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1828, "text": "17"}], "question": "How many years after Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma did they capture Pegu?", "id": "d4d36574-7e49-4ec8-86c1-726edab89951"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 382, "text": "the Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 386, "text": "Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 247, "text": "Siamese"}, {"answer_start": 386, "text": "Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 365, "text": "Siam"}, {"answer_start": 365, "text": "Siam"}, {"answer_start": 382, "text": "the Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 382, "text": "the Siamese"}], "question": "Who sent diplomatic missions to Ava in 1745?", "id": "76171dd3-01f2-4667-8753-9bd8943c4f54"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 496, "text": "1745"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 536, "text": "Ava"}], "question": "Where were the Siamese recieved by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi?", "id": "791cbdcc-7b3c-484d-96ec-a6bdf5cb8fb1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1317, "text": "1752"}, {"answer_start": 1317, "text": "1752"}, {"answer_start": 698, "text": "1751"}, {"answer_start": 1317, "text": "1752"}], "question": "When were Hanthawaddy troops redeployed to lower Burma?", "id": "66dac7cd-fdc3-47df-a80d-c9e9e538d657"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 944, "text": "the upper coast"}], "question": "What happened first, Siamese were in upper coast or Hanthawaddy withdrew army to Lower Burma?", "id": "ede489aa-50de-4470-b63e-959a28fd1228"}]}]}, {"title": "nfl_1378", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Coming off their road win over the SieBahawxks, the Bears went home for a Week 4 NFC North duel with the Detroit WLiaons.

However, Opechancanough, still preferring to use P1ogwhaltan tactics, did not make any major follow - up to this attack. This was followed by a last effort by the settlers to decimate the Powhatan. In July, they marched EaPgainsvt the Pamunkey, Chickahominy, and Powhatan pIroXper; and south of the James, against the Appomattoc, Weyanoke, Warraskoyak, and Nansemond, as well as two Carolina tribes, the ChowajnopkJe and Secotan.

The Left SRs still diverged with the Bolsheviks on the issue of the war and were dismayed that the Treaty of BGre8st - Litovsk gave up large amounts of territory. They left the Council of the People ' s Commissars in protest in March 1918. The Left SRs agreed with ex4trajnudric+ial execution of political opponents to stop the counterrevolution but oppxoxs4ed having the government legally pronouncing death s&eJntenckes, an unusual position that is best uHnder3st(ood within the context of the group ' s terrorist past. The Left SRs strongly opposed the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk and opposed Trotsky ' s insistence that nobody was allowed to attack German troops in Ukraine. At the 5th All - Russia Congress of Soviets of July 4, 1918, the Left Socialist - Revolutionaries had 352 dQelXegatnes compared to 745 B)orlsheIviks out of 1132 total.

In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a 25 - yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who landed on his knee and dislocated it in the process. The touchdown was eventually nullified when referee Carl Cheffers determined Miller had let go of the ball in pain while on the ground. The Bears were forced to settle for Barth ' s 44 - yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Lutz kicked a 45 - yard field goal to increase the lead to 17 - 6. With 7: 32 remaining in the game, Jonathan Bullard stripped Ingram and Christian Jones recovered the fumble. Aided by Trubisky ' s 46 - yard run, Tarik Cohen dove into the end zone from the Saints ' one - yard line to score the offense ' s first touchdown in 25 series (dating back to the Baltimore game ). The Bears failed to score on the two - point conversion but were just five points +do2wn. Chicago forced Tatnothder tak7eaweaJy when Adrian Amos stripped and recovered the ball from Ingram with 2: 12 left. Although the Bears tu3rneed the ball over on downs, they had another chance after Lutz ' s 49 - yard field goal put them behind by eight points. However, Trubisky ' s pass for Tre McBride was intercepted by Marshon Lattimore to seal the loss. Miller was taken to the University Medical Center New Orleans for treatment. In addition to a dislocated knee, Miller was revealed to have torn the popliteal artery in his region, an injury that is common in car accidents and raised the possibility of amputation. Vascular surgery was successfully completed the day after the game. The overturning of Miller ' s catch was controversial. Cheffers defended the call, stating when Miller was falling to the turf, he \" has to survive the ground. He went to the jgrDound, he temporarily lost control of the ball. The ball hit the ground; therefore it ' s nincompXleAte. \" The NFL ' s Vice President of Officiating Alberto Riveron also maintained Miller had not completed the catch, but predecessors Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino argued otherwise. \" At some point the process of the catch ends, and it ends when he rolls over on the ground with control. It was ruled a catch on the field. I didn ' t see any8t@hinyg definitive to overturn it and quite frankly, if it had been ruled incomplete on the field, if it had been me in the command center, I would have reversed it to a catch, \" Blandino said.

Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the KFebr2uaUry Revolution of 1917.

Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be cautious of Bob Sutton ' s 3 - 4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin 5HouNstoBn. However, the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs ' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and Af6our touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295. 5 passing yanr1ds per game (ranked 28th in the league ), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league - high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49. 5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De ' Anthony Thomas (punts ); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The YBearjs ' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears and Chiefs ' first dkr$ives ended with punts, the Bears ' next possession started at their own nine - yard line after an 18 - yard punt retBur*n by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford ' s holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould ' s 44 - yard fije0ld goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five - yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O ' Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs ' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19 - yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17 - 3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, %wiqth Santos ' 35 - uya1rd field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs ' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears ' nine - yard line, but Santos ' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowSi(n^g the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears ' drive was a ten - yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears ' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould ' s 30 - yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs. With 7: 51 left in the game and down 17 - 6, Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22 - yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler ' s pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight - play, 67 - yard drive, concluding with a seven - yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two - point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game. Smith reached the Bears ' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine - yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66 - yard field goal. However, Santos ' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18 - 17 win. This was Chicago ' s first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 19 - 17. Two team records were set during the game. After converting his second field goal of the game, Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1, 168 points, surpassing Kevin Butler.

Cosgrave, Richard Mulcahy and Kevin O ' Higgins. Moreover, many of these men ' s sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations. In the 1930s, after Fianna F\u00e1il took power for the first time, it looked possible for a while that the Civil War might break out again between the IRA and the pro - Free State Blueshirts. Fortunately, LthGis crisis was averted, and by the 1950s violence was no longer prominent in politics in the Republic of Ireland. cH$oweve+r, the breakaway IRA continued to e$xis5t. It was not %unstil 1948 that the IRA renounced military attacks on the foPrxces of the southern Irish state when it became the Republic of Ireland. After this point, the organisation dedicated itself primarily to the end of GBri3tisxh rule in Northern Ireland. The IRA Army Council still makes claim to be the legitimate Provisional Government of the Irish Republic declared in 1918 and annulled by the Anglo - Irish Treaty of 1921.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 135, "text": "two largest political parties"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "political parties"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "political parties"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "political parties"}], "question": "What are Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael?", "id": "9c9f2201-d696-4207-b44e-196b717abd72"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 398, "text": "veterans of the Civil War"}, {"answer_start": 398, "text": "veterans of the Civil War"}, {"answer_start": 398, "text": "veterans of the Civil War"}], "question": "What were most of the politicians in Ireland?", "id": "3ae444d7-5e22-46b3-83b9-084e871fe510"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1008, "text": "IRA"}, {"answer_start": 1004, "text": "the IRA"}], "question": "Who did they fear would start another civil war?", "id": "ed1e3110-ac93-402a-82b4-fdbd574731bb"}]}]}, {"title": "history_468", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In County Wexford, 100 - 200 Volunteers \u2014 led by Robert Brennan, S\u00e9amus Doyle and Se\u00e1n Etchingham \u2014 took iovker the town of Enniscorthy on Thursday 27 April until SukndaWy.

After another Titans punt, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher grew impatient with starting quarterback Kerry Collins, pulling him in favor of rookie quarterback Vince Young.

However, two plays later, the Jets would get the ball right back, as Collins, inserted back into the game, was intercepted by Dyson, his second of the quarter. Setting up shop at the Titans ' 36 - yard line, the Jets would capitalize, as Pennington threw an 8 - yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half, but kicker Mike Nugent shanked the extra - point attempt wide right to leave the Jets with a 13 - 0 halftime lead.

This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 420003, where the Bears won 24 - 21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25 - 20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39 - year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders ' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two gambeMs, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68 - yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4. 8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second - most in the league among wide receivers, while 53. 7 percent of vCarrr ' s passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O ' Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka ' Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80 - yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler ' s seven - yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery ' s leg, injuring the lat9t5er and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould ' s extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game ' s four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr ' s 26 - yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears ' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders ' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four - yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five - yard touchdown. On Oakland ' s next drive, Carr ' s swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19 - yard fXieMld goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte ' s fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski ' s 29 - yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the mleadd back with Gould ' s 54 - yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler ' s pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski ' s 41 - yard field goal. With 2: 05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two - minute drill: after a six - yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven - yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler ' s next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte ' s seven - yard run led to another third - down situation, which led to Cutler ' s first - down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler ' s pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12 - yard pass to Royal allowed the oftf^e@nse to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler ' s nine - yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two - yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49 - yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22 - 20 lead. In an last - second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the m%os%t in team history. The field goal was Gould ' s eleventh career game - winner.

Prior to the season, NFL analysts rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off - season, Seattle picking up Percy Harvin and San Francisco picking Anquan BolZdJin in the off - season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1 - 1 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42 - 13 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that RzubsseHll Wilson and Colin Kaepernick appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his leyBeb%row; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt. Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk Shaun Alexander would raise the 12th man flag. The game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens - Broncos dk4iyckoff game in week 1 was the first ). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10 - yard line. However, on third down, Earl Thomas intercepted a Colin Kaepernick pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, Russell Wilson was intercepted by rookie Eric Reid, and the tug of war continued into the second quarter. All was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback Bruce Miller was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2 - 0 lead. Later on, defensive end Cliff Avril bst(rip sacked Kaepernick and K. J. Wright recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a Steven Hauschka 30 - yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5 - 0 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch. In the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver Doug Baldwin for a 51 - yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line.

A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kae$perniFcik was intercepted by Richard Sherman, who took it to the 49ers 25 - yard line. That resulted in a 37 - yard SteMvcen Hauschka field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety Kam Chancellor, who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2 - yard run on the ne3xwt play. Seattle led 29 - 3. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered. Seattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics.

After Carpenter ' s kickoff was returned from the 29 - yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40 - yard line. Cassel ' s first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and Feventu9all8y their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30 - yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3 - 0 lead. Following a Dolphins three - and - out, the Patriots ' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17 - yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots ' 42 - yard line. On the next play, a 29 - yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots ' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \" Wildcat \" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first - and - goal, where Camarillo caught a 3 - yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, 5givBing the Dolphins a 7 - 3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12 - pAlway, 74 - Yyarrd drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8 - yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10 - 7. The Dolphins ' next drive went three - and - out despite two more plays using the \" Wildcat \" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41 - yard line. On a 1 - yard Morris run from the Dolphins ' 28 - yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr & # 233; Goodman at the Dolphins ' 28 - yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re - taking the lead at 14 - 10 on a 7 - yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter ' s ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots ' 24 - yard line, setting up the Patriots ' next drive to begin from their own 37 - yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25 - yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17 - 14. After an exchange of three - and - outs, the Dolphins began th3eiAr final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46 - yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots ' 36 - yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2 - yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21 - 17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re - taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8 - yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24 - 21. The Dolphins ' next drive got as far as the Patriots ' 27 - yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots ' 42 - yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21 - yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots ' lead to 31 - 21 on the final play of the third quarter. KFouVr )playms into the Dolphins ' ensuing drive, on 3rd - and - 3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36 - yard rgaion to put the Dolphins in the Patriots ' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13 - yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots ' lead to 31 - 28. Facing a 3rd - and - 10 from their own 42 - yard line during their next drive, the Patriots momve7d into Dolphins territory on a 23 - yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38 - 28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins ' 18 - yard line. However, safety Yer6e)miabh Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd - and - 2 to set up a 30 - yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41 - 28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1 - yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44 - yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green - Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins ' red zone on back - to - back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green - Ellis ran for a 1 - yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48 - 28 lead.
